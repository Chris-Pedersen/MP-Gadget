-------

Many files were released as Gadget-2 in GPL. GPL permits re-licensing them in GPLv3.

Other files without license issues are released in GPLv3.

Files with license issues are cooling.c and sfr_eff.c which
originated from files in P-Gadget. The algorithms are 13+ years old and
it is unclear if the original authors are still interested in keeping them
private. Please refer to header of each file for a discussion.
