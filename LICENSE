By default files are released in GPLv3.

Many files were released as Gadget-2 in GPL.
Those are not part of Gadget-2 are released in GPLv3 (or BSD?)

Files with license issues are cooling.c and sfr_eff.c which
originated from files in P-Gadget. The algorithms are 13+ years old and
it is unclear if the original authors are still interested in keeping them
private. Please refer to header of each file for a discussion.
